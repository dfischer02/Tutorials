[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5:](Application Configuration: Planning Parameters and inital setup)]

| What to do                                | What to focus on        | What you should see         |
| :--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| 1. Click on the ` Application Configuration ` . | This application facilitates a central place to set up planning required parameters, populate and initialize the planning process and set up different planning versions. <br> This is, the maintenance of the plan cost types that are leveraged during cost calculation as well as seeding of the initial plan data (Headcount data) by copying from a reference Actuals data slice. | ![xP&A Workforce Planning](5/3.png) <br><br>
| 2. Get an overview | Make yourself familiar with the application screen. | ![xP&A Workforce Planning Overview](5/4.png) <br><br>
| 3. Check the `Steps` section | The content provides a Step by step guide, with the caption Steps which helps the user for the setup process  | ![xP&A Workforce Planning](5/5.png) <br><br>
| 4. Click on `Guide Me!` | Users can decide to be guided through the setup process pressing the Guide Me! Button. Or configure the planning data individually with the General Settings and Copy Data functions. **Press on Guide Me!** | ![xP&A Workforce Planning](5/6.png) <br><br>
| 4.1 Select version you want to plan on `Aggregated_Plan` or `Detailed_Plan` | **In Step 1** <br> You can decide on which version to plan. Additional versions need to be created in the data model beforehand. One of the predefined planning levels is mapped to the version based on customizing in the dimension version. <br> <br> For Aggregated Planning (internal/external) Standard Version `Aggregated_Plan` the following plan levels are available: <br> - Company Code / Business Unit / Division (PL1) <br> - Company Code / Business Unit (PL2) <br> - Company Code / Cost Center (PL3) <br> - Company Code / Business Unit / Job Family (PL5) <br><br><br> <br><br> <br> <br> For Detailed Planning (Standard Version `Detailed_Plan`): <br> - Company Code / Cost Center (`Detailed Planning`) (PL4); in the Detailed Planning, data is not being aggregated, the planning level only defines the drill down in the table with regards to the organizational structure.| ![xP&A Workforce Planning](5/7.png)
| 4.2 Level of Planning | Mapping between Version and Planning Levels is maintained via property Planning Direction (Planning Direction) in the dimensions Version and `Plan_Level`. The default values used are Aggregated and Detailed. <br> <br> **Dimension Aggregation Level for Planning (`Plan_Level`)** <br> <br> General availability of a planning level for selection can be toggled by property Is Available (`IsAvailable`)  <br><br> <br> <br> **Dimension Version (Version)** <br> <br> The default / selected planning level for a particular version is stored in property Plan Level (`PlanLevel`). Only one planning level can be used for a particular version. <br><br><br> | ![xP&A Workforce Planning](5/8.png)  ![xP&A Workforce Planning](5/9.png) <br><br>
| 4.3 How to load data | **In Step 2** <br> <br> -	You can select to manually maintain initial cost parameter data (Midpoint Salary, Merit Increase (%), Bonus (%) …) or to copy the data that is already available in another version.<br> - Lastly you need to decide if you want to set up the plan data and parameters for Internal or External Workforce planning (for now we stick to Internal Workforce Planning) | ![xP&A Workforce Planning](5/10.png)
| 4.4 Click `Done` to close the dialogue | Depending on your settings for the plan level the drill down of the maintenance table will be changed automatically. The table displays the plan cost types which are relevant for costs calculations on the selected aggregated plan level dimensions. The user can now maintain adapt existing value or maintain new ones. <br><br> There are three kind of measures to be maintained: <br> - Midpoint Salary is the average salary for a new hire <br> - Percent rates like Bonus(%), Health Insurance (%) are always considered based on the monthly salary of an existing employee or the midpoint salary in case of a new hire <br> - Absolute Rates like Travel Costs Absolute Rate which are absolute per capita rates to be added during cost calculation | ![xP&A Workforce Planning](5/11.png) <br><br>
| 5. Click on button `External Workforce` | We now switch to the setup of parameters for external workforce. The Layout for the input table will change accordingly. <br><br><br> | ![xP&A Workforce Planning](5/12.png) <br><br>
| 6. Set up parameters for External Workforce | Similarly, to the plan setup for internal workforce the drill down for the table reflects the predefined plan level (plus Location dimension) <br> For external workforce the monthly (!) rate can be maintained on the selected organization level and location.  <br><br><br> | ![xP&A Workforce Planning](5/13.png) <br><br>
| 7. Press `Confirm` | Pressing `Confirm` will publish the central assumptions for the selected version and planning level combination.  <br><br><br>  <br><br> <br> Additionally, if option Initialize Plan Data After Publish switched on the planning horizon will be pre filled with actuals data from the reference period. The initialize Plan Data option should only be executed for one combination of Version + Planning Level, i.e. for the one the planner are supposed to plan on. <br><br> **Please note:** Initializing plan data in for more than one planning level per version will lead to duplicate results for the version in the reporting charts.  <br><br><br>  <br><br> Dimension Version (Version)<br><br> The plan horizon for a particular version can be maintained indicating the start and end period in properties Start Period of Planning ( `` StartPeriod `` ) and End Period of Planning ( `` EndPeriod `` ) respectively. The start period needs to be entered as `<YYYY>01` and end period as `<YYYY>12`. Only full years are supported, i.e. a total of 12, 24, 36... periods. <br> The reference period denotes the period from which actuals data is copied into the plan horizon for initializing the plan version in the non-predictive initialization. It needs to be maintained in property Reference Period for Seeding (`ReferencePeriod`) <br><br><br> <br><br> | ![xP&A Workforce Planning](5/14.png) ![xP&A Workforce Planning](5/15.png) ![xP&A Workforce Planning](5/16.png)
| 7.1 (Optional) Switch on `Use Predictive` and press `` Ok`` . <br> Click the Multi Action Trigger | **Please note**: <br> <br> - Currently the multi actions delivered with the content package do not contain the predictive scenarios as part of the standard delivery, but need to be added to the multi actions. <br> - Currently parameters set in the data actions within the multi actions are static and are not influenced by the customizing properties of dimensions Aggregation Level for Planning ( `` Plan_Level `` ) and Version (Version) <br><br> For a version for aggregated planning you will also see the option Use Predictive. The predictive forecast will allow you to initialize an additional version (public. `Smart_Predict` ) with a headcount prediction for the upcoming plan horizon based on the previous 5 years actuals. <br> If you switch on option Use Predictive and press ` OK` you will see a multi action trigger for your selected planning level to start the predictive forecast. <br><br><br> | ![xP&A Workforce Planning](5/17.png) <br><br> <br><br><br> ![xP&A Workforce Planning](5/18.png) <br><br>
